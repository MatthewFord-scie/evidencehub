								<h2>About the Evidence Hub</h2>
								<p>The <strong>Social Care Equity Evidence Hub</strong> is a central resource for evidence and analysis on equity
									in social care. It gathers research, case studies, and data from a range of sources to show how different
									groups access social care and where barriers may exist. The hub offers tools, reports, and insights that
									help professionals and decision-makers develop policies and practices that promote fairness.
									By sharing reliable evidence, the hub aims to drive change towards a social care system that treats all
									individuals equitably.

									<h3>What do we mean by 'equity' in social care?</h3>
									<p>Equity in social care means ensuring that everyone can access the services and support they need, regardless of their circumstances. It is the absence of unfair, avoidable, or remediable differences in access among groups of peopleâ€”whether defined by social, economic, demographic, or geographic factors, or by characteristics such as sex, gender, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation. Achieving equity means removing barriers and distributing resources fairly so that access is based on a person's individual needs</p>
								<br>
								<p><i>This is our working definition, adapted from the World Health Organization's <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-equity#tab=tab_1">definition of Health Equity</a></i></p>

								<h3>Included evidence</h3>
								<section class="post">
									<p>To be included in the Evidence Hub, content must: </p>
									<ul class="inclusion-list">
											<li>Focus on equity and access in social care.</li>
											<li>Be based on robust research that highlights disparities.</li>
											<li>Clearly describe research methods, including where, when, and by whom the study was conducted.</li>
											<li>Explain the context of the research, including social, cultural, or political factors.</li>
											<li>Support all conclusions with evidence and justify recommendations.</li>
											<li>Acknowledge any limitations or uncertainties in the findings.</li>
										</ul>
									<p>We will shortly be adding our detail inclusion criteria and methods of appraising the strength of the evidence for further guidance.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>How evidence is organised</h3>
									<p>The evidence is structured into key information modules. The image below shows the interface for searching and viewing evidence on our social care equity evidence hub.</p>
