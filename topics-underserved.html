									<h1>Underserved Populations</h1>
									<div class="box"><p>We are using the term <em>'underserved'</em> here to mean populations that face inequities in accessing and receiving care, resulting in poorer health outcomes compared to the general population.
										We have broken this down into <em>Groups by Demographic Factors (Age, Sex, Ethnicity, Education)</em>, <em>Groups by Social and Economic Factors</em> and <em>Groups by Health Status</em>.
										<br>The definition of "underserved" is context-specific, shaped by the specific circumstances, needs, and characteristics of the population. It highlights the importance of recognising and addressing the disparities in care provision to ensure equitable health outcomes for all individuals.</p></div>
									<br>
									<p>The chart below visually represents the percentages of adults, by ethnicity, in England receiving long-term support from social care services,
										alongside the overall ethnic percentages within the population. <br>
										This dual representation provides insight into social care equity, highlighting potential disparities across different ethnic groups.</p> <br>

									<div class="chart-container">
<!--										<canvas id="myChart2" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;height:500px"></canvas>-->
										<canvas id="ethnicChart" style="width:100%"></canvas>
									</div>
									<br>
									<br>
									<div class="box2"><p>The chart indicates significant variations in the percentage of adults receiving long-term support among ethnic groups. For instance, the data
										shows that while 79.6% of long-term support recipients identify as White British, the overall percentage of this group within the population is lower.
										This disparity suggests that White British individuals may be accessing social care services at a disproportionately higher rate compared to other ethnic groups.
										<br> <br>
										Groups such as Indian, Pakistani, and Black African individuals show relatively low percentages of long-term support recipients, despite representing a sizeable segment of the population.
										This raises concerns about accessibility and equity in social care provision for these communities.</p>
									</div>

								<p>But to fully understand and address social care equity, it’s essential to consider barriers faced by a range of underserved groups, as shown in the related evidence below. This additional data highlights
									issues that not only affect ethnic minorities but also other communities who experience social care inequity. </p> <br>

										<h3>Key Messages</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Individuals experiencing homelessness often face fragmented health and social care services,
												which complicates access and continuity of care. The lack of coordinated support among agencies creates barriers
												to meeting individuals' needs effectively. </li>

											<li>Stigma and misconceptions about homeless people’s circumstances and needs persist within health and social care systems.
												This stigma can lead to inadequate service provision and discourage homeless individuals from seeking necessary support. </li>

											<li>This report highlights the importance of trauma-informed and person-centred care as
												strategies to improve service engagement and outcomes for homeless individuals. Such approaches foster a supportive
												environment that can build trust and better meet the complex needs of this population.</li>

										<h3>Key Messages</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Limited Policy and Data Collection: Local authorities generally lack specific policies or centralised systems for recording sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data, although individual case records often contain this information. </li>
											<li>Support Gaps for LGBTQ+ Youth: While authorities employ various methods to support LGBTQ+ youth, there are notable gaps in staff knowledge and confidence in addressing these needs.</li>
											<li>Unequal Training Provision: Social workers more frequently receive training on LGBTQ+ issues than foster carers or residential staff, highlighting a need for broader, inclusive training across all roles.</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Commentary</h3>
										<p>Without dedicated policies or centralised recording of SOGI data, local authorities lack critical insights into the needs and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, making it harder to allocate resources effectively
											or address disparities. The gaps in staff knowledge and confidence, especially among foster carers and residential staff, further risk inconsistent support for these young people.
											Training disparities mean that while some youth might receive informed care, others may face misunderstandings or neglect due to staff unpreparedness. Addressing these gaps is essential to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals can access care that is responsive, inclusive, and equitable, ultimately creating a safer and more supportive environment within social services.</p>

											<h3>Key Messages</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Personal and environmental factors such as stigma, cultural identity, reluctance to discuss distress, and financial challenges hinder individuals from recognising and accepting mental health problems and seeking help.</li>
												<li>Long waiting times, language barriers, and poor communication negatively affect the relationship between service users and healthcare providers, leading to inadequate recognition of mental health needs.</li>
												<li>There is a significant imbalance of power and authority in healthcare interactions, compounded by cultural naivety and discrimination, particularly affecting black and minority ethnic service users, alongside a lack of awareness about available services.</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>Commentary</h3>
											<p>These factors highlight the critical importance of care equity in mental health services. When personal barriers, communication issues, and cultural insensitivity prevent individuals from receiving the support they need, it creates disparities in health outcomes. Care equity ensures that all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances, can access appropriate mental health care.</p>
