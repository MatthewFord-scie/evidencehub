								<h2>About the Evidence Hub</h2>
								<p>The <strong>Social Care Equity Evidence Hub</strong> is a central resource for evidence and analysis on equity in social care. It gathers research, case studies, and data from a range of sources to provide a clear picture of how social care services are experienced by different groups. The hub offers tools, reports, and insights that help professionals and decision-makers develop policies and practices that promote fairness. By sharing reliable evidence, the hub aims to drive change towards a social care system that treats all individuals equitably.

									<h3>What do we mean by equity?</h3>
									<p>Equity in social care means ensuring that everyone has fair access to the services and support they need, based on their individual circumstances. It involves recognising that people have different needs and may face various barriers, so resources and care are distributed in a way that helps everyone achieve similar health and wellbeing outcomes.</p>
