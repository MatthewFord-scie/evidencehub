									<h1>Further Analysis</h1>
									<p>The chart below visually represents the percentages of adults, by ethnicity, in England receiving long-term support from social care services,
										alongside the overall ethnic percentages within the population. </p> <br>

									<div class="chart-container">
										<!--										<canvas id="myChart2" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;height:500px"></canvas>-->
										<canvas id="ethnicChart" style="width:100%"></canvas>
									</div>
									<div class="box2">
										<p>This chart highlights disparities in access to long-term social care support across different ethnic groups in England. By comparing the percentage of adults receiving support with the overall ethnic distribution of the population, it provides insight into potential inequities in the system.</p>

										<p><strong>Key observations:</strong></p>
										<ul class="inclusion-list">
											<li>White British adults make up the largest proportion of those receiving long-term social care, closely aligning with their overall representation in the population.</li>
											<li>Ethnic minority groups, including Black African, Black Caribbean, South Asian, and Mixed ethnicities, appear to have lower representation in long-term care relative to their population share. This suggests potential barriers to accessing care, such as cultural factors, awareness of available services, or systemic inequalities in eligibility and assessment processes.</li>
											<li>White Gypsy/Traveller and White Irish groups may also experience unique access challenges, although their representation in care appears low, possibly due to underreporting or differing patterns of care reliance.</li>
											<li>The 'Unknown' category is notable, suggesting a data gap that may obscure a fuller understanding of access inequities.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>This data underscores the need for further investigation into whether these disparities reflect unmet need, differences in care preferences, or structural barriers in the social care system. Addressing these issues is essential for achieving equity in access to social care services.</p>
